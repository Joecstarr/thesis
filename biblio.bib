  abstract = {"Knot theory has proven to be a fascinating area of mathematical research, dating back about 150 years. Encyclopedia of Knot Theory provides short, interconnected articles on a variety of active areas in knot theory, and includes beautiful pictures, deep mathematical connections, and critical applications. Many of the articles in this book are accessible to undergraduates who are working on research or taking an advanced undergraduate course in knot theory. More advanced articles will be useful to graduate students working on a related thesis topic, to researchers in another area of topology who are interested in current results in knot theory, and to scientists who study the topology and geometry of biopolymers. Features Provides material which is useful and accessible to undergraduates, post-graduates, and full-time researchers Topics discussed provide an excellent catalyst for students to explore meaningful research and gain confidence and commitment to pursuing advanced degrees Edited and contributed to by top researchers in the field of Knot Theory"--},

  abstract = {In this paper we investigate the evolution of braided solar coronal loops. We assume that coronal loops consist of several internal strands which twist and braid about each other. Reconnection between the strands leads to small flares and heating of the loop to x-ray temperatures. Using a method of generating and releasing braid structure similar to a forest fire model, we show that the reconnected field lines evolve to a self-organised critical state. In this state, the frequency distributions of coherent braid sequences as well as flare energies follow power law distributions. We demonstrate how the presence of net helicity in the loop alters the distribution laws.},

  abstract = {The tabulation of all prime knots up to a given number of crossings was one of the founding problems of knot theory in the 1800s, and continues to be of interest today. Here we extend the tables from 16 to 19 crossings, with a total of 352 152 252 distinct non-trivial prime knots.  The tabulation has two major stages: (1) a combinatorial enumeration stage, which involves generating a provably sufficient set of candidate knot diagrams; and (2) a computational topology stage, which involves identifying and removing duplicate knots, and certifying that all knots that remain are topologically distinct. In this paper we describe the many different algorithmic components in this process, which draw on graph theory, hyperbolic geometry, knot polynomials, normal surface theory, and computational algebra. We also discuss the algorithm engineering challenges in solving difficult topological problems systematically and reliably on hundreds of millions of inputs, despite the fact that no reliably fast algorithms for these problems are known.},

  abstract = {There exist naturally occurring enzymes (topoisomerases and recombinases), which, in order to mediate the vital life processes of replication, transcription, and recombination, manipulate cellular DNA in topologically interesting and non-trivial ways [24, 30]. These enzyme actions include promoting the coiling up (supercoiling) of DNA molecules, passing one strand of DNA through another via a transient enzyme-bridged break in one of the strands (a move performed by topoisomerase), and breaking a pair of strands and recombining them to different ends (a move performed by recombinase). An interesting development for topology has been the emergence of a new experimental protocol, the topological approach to enzymology [30], which directly exploits knot theory in an effort to understand enzyme action. In this protocol, one reacts artificial circular DNA substrate with purified enzyme               in vitro               (in the laboratory); the enzyme acts on the circular DNA, causing changes in both the euclidean geometry (supercoiling) of the molecules and in the topology (knotting and linking) of the molecules. These enzyme-caused changes are experimental observables, using gel electrophoresis to fractionate the reaction products, and               rec A               enhanced electron microscopy [15] to visualize directly and to determine unambiguously the DNA knots and links which result as products of an enzyme reaction. This experimental technique calls for the building of knot-theoretic models for enzyme action, in which one wishes mathematically to extract information about enzyme mechanism from the observed changes in the DNA molecules.},

(Murasugi and the author have proven them prime; Conway claims proof that the tables are complete.) Including the trivial type, there are precisely 250 prime knots with ten or fewer crossings.},
