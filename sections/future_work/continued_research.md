## Continued Tabulation
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

In this section, we describe the next steps for what has been discussed in @ch-tabulation. The first
item to tackle in our future tabulation work is the reconciliation of our table of arborescent
tangles with the algebraic table produced by Gren, Sulkowska, and Gabrovšek
[@gren2025classificationalgebraictangles]. Following this our efforts take two forms, first a
collection of minimalization problems for the data we have generated. Second, is the expansion of
this work to cover the complete set of two string tangles, the arborescent and the polygonal.
