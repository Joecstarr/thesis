<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

In this section, we describe the direct next steps for what has been discussed

minimalization problems for the data generated in this thesis. The second is the
expansion of this work to cover the total set of two string tangles.

```{include} ./minimalization.md

```

```{include} ./polygonal.md
