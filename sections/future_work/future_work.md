title: Future Directions and Undergraduate Research
---

In this chapter, we describe the future research directions for the tabulation
of tangles. The future directions take two forms. First, the direct next steps
to the work of this thesis (@sec-future_work-continued_tabulation). Second, an
undergraduate research research experience program with a collection of undergraduate
problems (@sec-future_work-tabulation).
