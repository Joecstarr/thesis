## Tangles as Undergraduate Research

The accessibility of knot theory and tangles was discussed in the introduction
@sec-intro-intuit_knot_theory this elaborates on how that accessibility can be
leveraged to engage Undergraduates in research. Throughout this thesis, we have
investigated and observed the depth of tangle tabulation. We have also seen,
even through the structure of this thesis itself, how easily portions of tangle
tabulation can be "peeled off" and decomposed as a self-contained project. This
depth and ability to decompose discrete projects makes tangle tabulation a rich
discipline for undergraduate research.
