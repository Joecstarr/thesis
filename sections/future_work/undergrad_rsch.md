# Tangles as Undergraduate Research

The accessibility of knot theory and tangles was discussed in the in
introduction (Chapter \ref{pt-introduction}) this elaborates on how that
accessibility can be leveraged to engage Undergraduates in research. Throughout
this thesis we've investigated and observed the depth of tangle tabulation.
We've also seen, even through the structure of this thesis itself, how easily
portions of tangle tabulation can be "peeled off" and decomposed as a singular
self-contained project.
