## Tangles as Undergraduate Research

The accessibility of knot theory and tangles was discussed in the introduction
@sec-intro-intuit_knot_theory this elaborates on how that accessibility can be
leveraged to engage Undergraduates in research. Throughout this thesis, we have
investigated and observed the depth of tangle tabulation. We have also seen,
even through the structure of this thesis itself, how easily portions of tangle
tabulation can be "peeled off" and decomposed as a self-contained project. This
depth and ability to decompose discrete projects makes tangle tabulation a rich
discipline for undergraduate research. In previous sections, we defined a
product management (@sec-product-management) and software life cycle
(@sec-life-cycle) for use in organizing undergraduate research. These processes
can be combined with fully structured, partially structured, or unstructured
problem statements, depending on student maturity, to create product worthy
undergraduate research projects. Using this process for training undergraduate
researches is enhanced by sequencing parts of or multiple problems with a
gradual release of responsibility model as described by Fisher and Frey
[@fisherBetterLearningStructured2013].
