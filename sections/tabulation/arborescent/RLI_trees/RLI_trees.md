### Right Leaning Identity CWPTT
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

The CWPTT are sufficient for distinguishing any two arborescent tangles via
moves on their trees. Unfortunately, the equivalence class of CWPTT is still too
large for computational enumeration to be feasible. The time required for
pairwise comparisons grows badly exponentially. Luckily, from the class of CWPTT
for an arborescent tangle, we can select a unique preferred form that allows for
efficient direct enumeration by computer. To achieve this we will define two
additional conditions for CWPTT, first the right leaning condition, and second,
the identity condition. We call these preferred CWPTT **Right Leaning Identity
Canonical Weighted Planar Tangle Trees (RLITT)**.
