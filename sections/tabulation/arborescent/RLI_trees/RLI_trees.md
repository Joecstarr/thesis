### Right Leaning Identity CWPTT

CWPTT are sufficient for distinguishing any two arborescent tangles from moves
on their trees. Unfortunately, the class of CWPTT is still too large for
computational enumeration to be feasible, the time required for pairwise
comparisons grows badly exponentially. Luckily, from the class of CWPTT for an
arborescent tangle, we can select a unique preferred form that allows for
efficient direct enumeration by computer. We call this preferred form a **Right
Leaning Identity Canonical Abbreviated Weighted Planar Tangle Tree (RLITT)**.
