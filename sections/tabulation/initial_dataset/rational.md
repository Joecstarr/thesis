### Rational Tangles

We will see in this section that the rational tangles have a deeply
combinatorial nature which makes them among the simplest classes of tangle that
can be described. This simplicity leads to the rational tangles, and their knot
closures, to be some of the most commonly studied objects in knot theory.

#### Construction

In our development of the modified tangle calculus in @subsec-tangle_operations
we described a way to glue tangles together forming successively more complex
objects. That approach will form the basis for our construction of the rational
tangles. We will start however, with an intuitive description of the
construction. Start with a $0$ tangle, imagine now, a crank is attached to the
right (east) side of the tangle, seen in @fig-rat_tang-crank. If we take the
crank and crank it clockwise a half turn we introduce a positive twist, it is
important to notice that we can crank $n$ half turns to make an integral $n$
tangle.

```

From here, take the crank and move it to the bottom (south) side of the tangle.
We again add $n$ half clockwise turns, this time building a vertical integral
tangle. Alternating, right and bottom sets of half turns, as seen in
@fig-rat_tang-crank_many, builds a rational tangle. We call the list of counts
of right and bottom twists the Twist Vector for the rational tangle.

To formalize this intuitive description we will assume the existence of integral
tangles
