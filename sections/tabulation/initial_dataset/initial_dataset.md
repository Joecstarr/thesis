## The First Tangle Datasets

This chapter will describe the methodology used to answer two of the essential
questions detailed in @sec-intro-overview.

> "How do I systematically construct rational tangles?", "How do I tell two
> rational tangles I make apart?", and "How many rational tangles can I write
> down?"

> "How do I systematically construct Montesinos tangles?" and "How do I tell two
> Montesinos tangles I make apart?", and "How many Montesinos tangles can I
> write down?"

The methodologies outlined here are for relatively simple classes of tangle. For
each, we will give a grounding for the thought process we will use to approach
the more difficult algebraic/arborescent case.
