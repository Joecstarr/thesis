title: Software and its Engineering
---

We now shift from the mathematical world to the world of computers and software. We start with a
brief overview of the goals of product management and software engineering
(@sec-product-vs-project). This includes the development of model software engineering processes
tailored for use in professional and undergraduate mathematics research. Next, we use the
engineering concepts of @sec-product-vs-project to compare and contrast a collection of tools
currently available for use in knot theory research (@sec-surveyoftools). Using the analysis of
current tools, and our software process we define a set of requirements and a system design for a
new general purpose knot theory software toolbox (@sec-archofktst). Finally, using this system
design, and following our process, we present documentation for the software units that satisfy the
tabulation theory of [Chapter 6 Tabulation](../tabulation/tabulation.md).
