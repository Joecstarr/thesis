## Montesinos Tangle Generation Runner

The Montesinos generation runner takes the form of a web application. This is
accomplished by compiling the generation component with Emscripten
[@zakaiEmscriptenLLVMtoJavaScriptCompiler2011] into WebAssembly
[@WebAssemblyCoreSpecification2]. This WebAssembly is then wrapped with
JavaScript to allow communication with a job dispatching server. Having the
runner take this form allows for the parallel, simultaneous running of the
generation on multiple machines.

Generation jobs distributed by the job server take the form of partial sets of
the twist vectors described by a stencil. The jobs are generated by implementing
@find-mont-sten into the job server.
