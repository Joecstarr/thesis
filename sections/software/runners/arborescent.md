## Arborescent Tangle Generation Runner

The Arborescent Tangle Generation Runner follows the same pattern as the
Montesinos case. The generator is compiled into WebAssembly and wrapped with
javascript. Where the two runners differ is in job generation, in the
arborescent case, jobs are built by partial collections of rootstocks and
scions.
