One of the most pervasive ideas held by amateur software developers is that
documentation means simply commenting your code. This idea and its consequences
are one of the fundamental differentiators between a piece of software becoming
a project and a product. By project here we mean a short-lived project with no
prospect of long-term reusage or usage by a community. Much preferable is the
creation of products that are long-term reusable, extensible, and portable
investments of time and energy.

The creation of a product requires planning and documentation of a system far
beyond simple code comments. The creation of a product requires the thoughtful
and deliberate consideration of the goals of the software. For example,
identifying where time invested now to create a robust system can save time
later, and enumerating and analyzing risk to the project can reduce the chance
of total project failure.

The creation of a software product has two phases, a generic (not software
specific) high-level product management/development phase followed by a detailed
software engineering phase. Having this two-pass approach allows for the project
to be well and thoroughly defined and assessed before any technical engineering
work is started. Reducing the risk of a project being intractable based on the
product constraints. The reminder of this section will give context to product
management and software engineering practices, with preparing undergraduates for
research as the goal.
