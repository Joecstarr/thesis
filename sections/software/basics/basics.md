## Project vs. Product
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

One of the most pervasive ideas held by amateur software developers is that documentation means
simply commenting your code. This idea and its consequences are one of the fundamental
differentiators between a piece of software being a project or becoming a product. A project is
short-lived with no consideration of long-term reuse or usage by a community. Much preferred is the
creation of products that are long-term, reusable, extensible, and portable investments of time and
energy (effort).

The creation of a product requires planning and documentation of a system far beyond simple code
comments. When developing a product, we must include thoughtful and deliberate consideration of the
goals and how we will achieve them. For example, identifying where effort invested now to create a
robust system can save effort later, and enumerating and analyzing risk to the product can reduce
the chance of total product failure.

The creation of a software product has two phases, a generic (not software specific) high-level
product management/development phase followed by a detailed software engineering phase. Having this
two-pass approach allows for the product to be well and thoroughly defined and assessed before any
technical engineering work is started, reducing the risk of a product being intractable based on the
product constraints. The remainder of this chapter will give context to product management and
software engineering practices, with preparing undergraduates for research as the goal. We will
start with a design for a course on teaching project management to undergraduate researchers. We
then develop a software engineering process for use in mathematics reasearch.
