### Implementation

Once the design of a unit is complete, we are ready to implement (program) that
unit. There are no special activities in the implementation phase outside of
programming effort. It is important to strictly follow the unit and system
design in this phase. If deficiencies in design are found, the V model allows
for that feedback to be pushed to earlier phases and addressed by flowing back
through the V model. Good practice in the programming stage is to add a comment
describing each unit implementation as well as each data an functional memeber.
The goal of these comments is to briefly describe the code for future readers,
but they cannot replace the written documentation from previous sections.
Additional good practices are to consistently format the code with a common
style, utilize good data hygiene with a version control system, and favor simple
implementations over "clever".
