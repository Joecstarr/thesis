## Instruction of Product Management
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

Undergraduate researchers, in most academic disciplines, have little exposure to
systematic product management. Outside a structured classroom setting, an
undergraduate researcher may have never completed a project, let alone worked on
a product. Giving undergraduate researchers a minimal set of product management
tools increases their ability to estimate and bring together successful
products.

In this section we describe a course design for a basic undergraduate course in
product management. The perspective of the course design is not software
focused, but is intended for general use across disciplines. In six weeks of
instruction, this course introduces students to the key concepts in product
management needed to ideate and systematically complete complex products. The
design utilizes the "Backward Design" of Wiggins and McTighe
[@wigginsUnderstandingDesign2008]. Many of the ideas come from Pressman and
Maxim [@pressmanSoftwareEngineeringPractitioners2015a] but have been massaged to
be less software focused. Full course design and template documents are found
published on GitHub [@joestarrJoecstarrMfaCoBPMV1002025].
