Undergraduate researchers, in most academic disciplines, have little exposure to
systematic product management. Outside a structured classroom setting, an
undergraduate researcher may have never completed a project, let alone a worked
on a product. Giving undergraduate researchers a minimal set of product
management tools increases their ability to estimate and bring together
successful products.

The remainder of this section contains a course design for a basic undergraduate
course in product management. The perspective of the course design is not
software focused, but is intended for general use accross disciplines. In six
weeks of instruction, this course introduces students to the key concepts in
product management needed to ideate and systematically complete complex
products. The design utilizes the "Backward Design" of
[@wigginsUnderstandingDesign2008]. Many of the ideas come from
[@pressmanSoftwareEngineeringPractitioners2015a] but have been massaged to be
less software focused. Full course design and template documents are found
published on GitHub [@joestarrJoecstarrMfaCoBPMV1002025].

### Stage 1 - Desired Results

#### Established Goals

Product management is an important part of being a successful in academia as
well as industry. To take a product from ideation to a publishable product can
be easy when everything goes right. However, while completing a product, issues
often arise that impact the ability to meet product goals. This course will
introduce product management concepts that will enable practitioners to mitigate
these hidden impacts.

The overarching theme for the course is:

> Be kind to future you.

#### Transfer

_Students will be able to independently use their learning to…_

Students should leave this course knowing that there are tools to reach for when
planning in future products. Additionally, students should have surface
understanding of at least one specific tool to manage each section of the
product life cycle.

#### Meaning

##### Understandings

_Students will understand that…_

-   Product creation is an accomplishable endeavor.
-   Products have long lives, but projects die fast.
-   "Future you" is a person that you need to collaborate with.
-   Product documentation makes life easier.
-   Stakeholder agreement is essential.
-   Why risk management from the "Indiana Jones School of Risk Management"
    [@thomsettIndianaJonesSchool1992] is bad.
-   Products fall behind "One day at a time" Fred Brooks
    [@brooksMythicalManmonthEssays2013]

##### Essential Questions

-   How do you ideate for a product?
-   How do you design a product plan?
-   How do you evaluate risk?
-   How do you create tasks for a product?
-   How do you create a product schedule?

#### Acquisition

##### Students will know…

-   How to use Crazy8s for ideation.
-   How a basic product plan is used.
-   How a risk management plan is used.
-   How a product is scheduled.

##### Students will be skilled at…

Students will be able to utilize product management tools in practice.

### Stage 2 - Evidence and Assessment

#### Evaluative Criteria

-   Students have a well-formed product plan.
-   Students have a well-formed risk management plan.
-   Students have a well-formed product schedule.
-   Students complete a product.

#### Assessment Evidence

##### Performance Task(s):

Students will complete a collection of product management documents for their
product. The course will culminate with a 1:1 retrospective meeting where the
student will present their completed material and reflect on successes and
failures in their planning.

##### Other Evidence:

Students will have a touchpoint meeting every other week, with meeting minutes
summarized in a canvas reflection.

### Stage 3 - Learning Plan: _Summary of Key Learning Events and Instruction_

The course will contain five to six weeks of instruction followed by ~10 weeks
of lightly supervised working time. The following is a high-level overview of
the course schedule:

1. Week 1 and 2:
    1. Product ideation
2. Week 2:
    1. A product plan
    2. Overview
    3. Assessment and control
3. Week 3:
    1. Requirements design
4. Week 4:
    1. Risk Management
5. Week 5:
    1. Product Schedule
6. Week 7-15: Individual work
7. Retrospective meeting
