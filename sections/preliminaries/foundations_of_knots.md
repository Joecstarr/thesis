## Foundations of Knots

We now begin a more formal description of the foundations of the theory of
knots. Our treatment will begin with the general definition of knots, as well as
similar knot-like objects. Next, we will discuss ways in which two knots can be
considered equivalent. With this, we'll give an example of a common invariant
for knots. Finally, we conclude with descriptions of the notational strategy
that inspired the rest of this thesis, the Conway notation.
