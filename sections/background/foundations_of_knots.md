# Foundations of knots

We can now begin a more formal description for the foundation of the theory of
knots. Our treatment will begin with the general definition of knots, as well as
similar knot-like objects. Next we will discuss ways in which two knots can be
considered equivalent. With this we'll give an example of a common invariant for
knots. We will conclude with descriptions of the notational strategy
underpinning the rest of this thesis.
