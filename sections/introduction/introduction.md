# Introduction

There exists a common view of advanced mathematics as esoteric nonsense only
understandable by elite thinkers. While that sentiment is perhaps deserved by
some mathematical disciplines, knot theory is an area of advanced mathematics
that offers deep significance as well as general accessibility. A lay person can
be taught the basic structures of knot theory while it takes years to master the
details.
