The tabulation, creation of a list, of mathematical knots has been a core area of mathematics
research for over 150 years. A key breakthrough in knot tabulation was Conway's development of a
building block for knots, the two string tangle. A two string tangle is a portion of a mathematical
knot bound within a ball and intersecting that ball in exactly four points. A table of these objects
has been called:

Without such a table of tangles, mathematicians and scientists are in the position of a chemist who
possesses a table of fatty acids but no periodic table. In this thesis we answer, in part, this
call.

As we progress through this thesis, we produce successively larger and more complete tables of
tangles. Each table we produce requires the development of the mathematical theory demonstrating
that what we have produced is what we say it is. Then, for each tangle type we develop the theory
for, we also develop a collection of software designs used to convince a computer to quickly
generate large tables of tangles. We will also discuss ways that the accessibility of knot theory
and in particular tabulation make this domain a candidate for undergraduate research. As part of our
discussion of undergraduate research, we will outline a software engineering process particularly
suited for undergraduate research in knot theory, as well as a model life cycle for an undergraduate
research experience in computational knot theory.
