The tabulation, creation of a list of provably unique objects, of mathematical
knots has been a core area of mathematics research for over 150 years. A key
breakthrough in knot tabulation was Conway's development of a building block for
knots, the two string tangle. Where a two string tangle is a portion of a
mathematical knot bound within a circle and intersecting that circle in exactly
four points. A table of these objects has been called:

With only tables of knots but without such a table of tangles, we are in the
position of a chemist who possesses a table of fatty acids but no periodic
table.

In this thesis we, in part, answer this call. As we progress, we produce
successively larger and more complete tables of tangles. Each table we produce
requires the development of the mathematical theory demonstrating that what we
have produced is what we say it is. Then, for each tangle type we develop the
theory for, we also develop a collection of software designs used to convince a
computer to quickly generate large tables of tangles.

Additionally, we will discuss ways that the accessibility of knot theory and in
particular tabulation make the domain a candidate for undergraduate research. As
part of our discussion of undergraduate research we will outline a software
engineering process particularly suited for undergraduate research in knot
theory. As well as a model life cycle for an undergraduate research experience
in computational knot theory.
