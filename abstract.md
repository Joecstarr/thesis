The enumeration of provably unique (tabulation) of mathematical knots has been a
core area of research for over 150 years. One important advancement in this area
was Conway's development of a building block for knots, the tangles. Formally,
an $n$-sting tangle is a portion of a knot diagram enclosed in a Jordan curve
that intersects the knot in exactly $2n$ points. The tabulation of the two
string tangles, Conway's building blocks, has been called:

With only tables of knots but without such a table of tangles, we are in the
position of a chemist who possesses a table of fatty acids but no periodic
table.

In this thesis we, in part, answer this call. We develop the theory needed to
tabulate tables of successively more complex classes of tangles. We start with
with the rational and Montesinos tangles then conclude with the arborescent
tangles, an analogue for the algebraic tangles. For each of these classes of
tangle, we additionally develop a collection of software designs used to
efficiently and scalably compute tables of these tangles to high crossing
number.

Additionally, we will discuss ways that the accessibility of knot theory and in
particular tabulation make the domain a candidate for undergraduate research. As
part of our discussion of undergraduate research we will outline a software
engineering process particularly suited for undergraduate research in knot
theory. As well as a model life cycle for an undergraduate research experience
in computational knot theory.
