The enumeration of provably unique mathematical knots, tabulation, has been a core area of research
for over 150 years. One important advancement in this area was Conway's development of a building
block for knots, the tangles. Formally, a $n$-string tangle is a portion of a knot diagram enclosed
in a Jordan curve that intersects the knot in exactly $2n$ points. The tabulation of the two string
tangles, Conway's building blocks for knots, has been called:

Without such a table of tangles, researchers are in the position of a chemist who possesses a table
of fatty acids but no periodic table. In this thesis we answer, in part, this call.

This thesis develops the theory needed to tabulate tables of successively more complex classes of
tangles. We start with the rational and Montesinos tangles and then conclude with the arborescent
tangles, often called the algebraic tangles. For each of these classes of tangles, we additionally
develop a collection of software designs used to efficiently and scalably compute tables of these
tangles to high crossing number (19). We will also discuss ways that the accessibility of knot
theory and in particular tabulation make the domain a candidate for undergraduate research. As part
of our discussion of undergraduate research, we will outline a software engineering process
particularly suited for undergraduate research in knot theory, as well as a model life cycle for an
undergraduate research experience in computational knot theory.
